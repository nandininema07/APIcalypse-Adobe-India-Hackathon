The spirit of openness， trust，sel f -confidence. and optimism that had made the movement fee l so inviting i n the early sixties gradually evaporated. Even the most dedicated act i vists withdrew， tired of being denounced for providing leadership or for having ideas or for being white or for being heterosexual or for want- i ng to have a f a mily or for being male or for worry i ng about a way to make a living. Most s t i ll re t ained their analysis of what was wrong in society， but they no longer believed that they could be the ones to change things. They continued to oppose the evils they h a d seen， but opposition was now a matter of interna l consciousness rather than public social activism.",
