      "text": "2) Statistics for Comment Classes: We manually label each of the 706 comments into seven categories, which are later used as the gold comments [2] for evaluation (Section V). Fig. 4 shows the fraction of different categories of popular discussion comments that follow the code segments or pro- gramming answers from the three domains- Java, Android and C#. We are particularly interested about these two categories– bugs (C4 ) and tips (C3 ) as they contain non-trivial information and the users making such comments are likely to possess a certain level of expertise on the posted code. We observe that each of the programming domains contains a significant amount of such comments which is promising. For example, 20% of C# comments and 14% for Java comments belong to these categories. On the other hand, Android has the maximum of 34% comments that contain identified bugs and improvement or troubleshooting tips for the posted code. One possible explanation could be that Android is relatively less mature than the other two platforms, and thus, it encourages more discussions about bugs and further improvement. Such findings actually underpin our intuition about Stack Overflow discussion comments. Although the comment classification is a bit subjective (i.e., might face reproducibility issue), and the dataset analyzed is not large, the findings are still convincing enough to demonstrate that Stack Overflow comments are a potential source for insightful information about the code.

We consider the top five API topics for each of the documents in the corpus, determine topic-document-frequency, and sort the topics according to their frequencies. Due to space limitation, the ranked topics are available for download elsewhere4. We then investigate if there exists any regular pattern among the topics from different domains.
