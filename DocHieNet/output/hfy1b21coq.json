Section 221(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) grants the Secretary of State visa revocation authority and the Department has used this authority to revoke more than 1,250 visas since 9/11. All of these revocations were based on information suggesting possible terrorist activities or l inks. The use of the revocation authority is one element i n a multi-layered, interlocking system of border security measures. Its present value as a counter-terrorist measure cannot be evaluated without reference to the creation of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), which were built on and incorporated the Department’s Intelligence and Research Bureau (INR/TIPOFF) TIPOFF program. The revocation process now supplements the terrorist watchlisting work of TSC, which provides the vast majority of t he derogatory information on specific individuals t hat prompts the Department of State to revoke a visa.",

Thus, the name is i n both agencies'lookout systems prior to the Department’s receipt of any request for revocation from TSC. These lookouts immediately put safeguards in place that prevent further visa issuance or admission to the United States and in effect provide “breathing room” for the revocation process to proceed from the very first step. The Department ’ s subsequent entry of a revocation lookout serves to further inform the lookout users that a visa that had been issued has been revoked, but is not essential to ensure t hat t he subject i s not admitted to the United States.",
