For the majority of recommendations the response indicates that  further work is S required before the Government can make decisions on the particular steps it will take， as the recommendations are wide ranging and have significant implications for a range of government agencies and disabled people. The Government's ability to respond to some of these recommendations is also affected by the need to consider the results of consultation processes before taking decisions. This particularly affects the recommendations relating to the Health and Disability Commissioner and the Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001. In other cases， however， the Government has already implemented several responses that are consistent with the Select Committee's recommendations， or is expanding and modifying its existing work programmes so that they are consistent with the Select Committee's recommendations.",

The current fiscal climate means that the immediate focus must be on using existing resources in more cost-effective ways rather than on major structural change or increased levels of funding.",
