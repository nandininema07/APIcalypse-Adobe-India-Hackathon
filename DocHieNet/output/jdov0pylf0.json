While CTA personnel, or its designee, have the opportunity to witness and approve all tests and inspections performed in support of this effort, it should be noted that many of these activities occur as part of the normal development and equipment receipt processes and may prove inefficient to set aside specific timeframes for conducting these tests. It should also be noted that these inefficiencies could cause delays in achieving the schedule’s critical path activities. ACS may modify inspection and verification points identified during this process if recommended by the CTA. Modifications may be made based on inspection results at the time the Quality Assurance Plan is reviewed or at any time during the inspection and verification process. Examples of quality inspection data include: inspection and test results, internal audit results, supplier QA acceptance records, calibration data, and documented deviations or waivers. Carrying out system inspections and verification is the sole responsibility of ACS.",
