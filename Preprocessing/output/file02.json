New topics emerge due to technology and methodology changes in the market which often are brought into the ISTQB program as new Expert Level syllabi. However, not all topics are suited for the Expert Level. For this reason, the extension syllabi are established at the Foundation Level to expand the ISTQB program to incorporate new or updated knowledge. New extensions shall be discussed and introduced by the ISTQB periodically. Extensions may be established at the Advanced Level as well, but that is beyond the scope of this document.",
