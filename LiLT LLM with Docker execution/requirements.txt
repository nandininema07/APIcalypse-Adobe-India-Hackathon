# requirements.txt
pypdfium2 # For PDF parsing (fast and robust, zero-OCR for text/layout)
numpy
scipy
scikit-learn # For basic ML utilities or metrics
torch # For PyTorch models (LiLT, Donut)
transformers # Hugging Face for LiLT, Donut models
opencv-python # For visual analysis if needed (e.g., image parsing)
PyYAML # For config.yaml
loguru # For better logging (optional, can stick to built-in logging)

# Consider adding for potential ML model specifics
# sentencepiece # often a dependency for transformer models
# accelerate
# bitsandbytes # for quantization if not using torch built-in
